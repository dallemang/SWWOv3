                        Read-Me File for acm-book.cls
                        -----------------------------

                         A LaTeX class file for the
                              ACM book series



The acm-book.cls file provides a simple LaTeX class file for books in the
Association for Computing Machinery book series. As an author of a book in
this series, you can use this class file to produce a manuscript that looks
roughly like finished books will look. This ensures that you don't create
math displays that are too wide. It also ensures that your algorithms and
computer code fit in the text measure.

Please note that your manuscript will not look exactly like the final book.
There are various reasons for this, not the least of which is that this
class file does not use the same font families as the final book.

The acm-book class is based on the LaTeX book class. To use it, specify the
following \documentclass command at the top of your book's root file:

  \documentclass{acm-book}

This will produce a manuscript using the Computer Modern fonts that come
with all TeX installations. If you want to use Times Roman instead, specify
this command:

  \documentclass[times]{acm-book}

Other than this command, you can use all the commands available with LaTeX
book style.


SAMPLE FILES
------------

The following sample files accompany the acm-book.cls file. Please note that
the text in the files does not represent an actual book in the ACM book series.

acm-book.tex
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a template root file that acts as the main file for your book. This
is the file that you process with LaTeX. It contains the \documentclass
command along with an \include command for each division of your book:
front matter, chapters, appendixes, bibliography, biographies, and index.

It is important to use a root file with \include commands so that your book
is processed as a coherent whole, rather than simply treating each chapter
as a separate book.

front.tex
~~~~~~~~~

This is a template for the front matter of your book. It shows how to code
the book title, your name and affiliation, the abstract and keywords, the
table of contents, list of figures, list of tables, and the preface.

chap01.tex
~~~~~~~~~~

This is a sample chapter file. It contains examples of the chapter title,
section heads, subsection heads, figures, a simple table, and an exercise
list. 

appa.tex
~~~~~~~~

This is a sample appendix file.

biblio.tex
~~~~~~~~~~

This is a sample bibliography file.

bio.tex
~~~~~~~

This is a sample author biography file.
